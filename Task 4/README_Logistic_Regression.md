**Recommendation**: Use threshold 0.31 for optimal sensitivity-specificity balance in medical screening.

### Feature Importance Analysis

**Top 5 Most Predictive Features:**
1. **texture_worst** (coef: +1.434) - Increases malignancy risk
2. **radius_se** (coef: +1.233) - Variability in radius measurements  
3. **symmetry_worst** (coef: +1.061) - Asymmetry indicates malignancy
4. **concave points_mean** (coef: +0.953) - Concavity patterns
5. **concavity_worst** (coef: +0.911) - Worst concavity measurements

**Clinical Insight**: Texture irregularity and shape asymmetry are strongest cancer indicators.

### Sample Interview Insights

**Q: "How would you interpret a precision of 97.5% in medical context?"**

**Professional Answer**: "A precision of 97.5% means that when our model predicts a patient has cancer, we're correct 97.5% of the time. Clinically, this translates to a very low false alarm rate - only 1 out of 40 positive predictions is incorrect. This high precision minimizes patient anxiety and unnecessary follow-up procedures while maintaining excellent diagnostic accuracy."
