🎯 Learning Objectives Achieved
1. Data Exploration & Understanding
✅ Imported dataset and explored basic information

✅ Analyzed data types, shape, and structure

✅ Identified missing values and their patterns

✅ Examined categorical and numerical variables

2. Missing Value Treatment
✅ Age: Imputed using median by Pclass and Sex groups

✅ Embarked: Filled with mode (most frequent value)

✅ Cabin: Created binary feature for presence/absence (77% missing)

3. Feature Engineering
✅ Extracted titles from passenger names

✅ Created family size feature (SibSp + Parch + 1)

✅ Generated is_alone binary feature

✅ Categorized ages into groups (Child, Teenager, Young Adult, Adult, Senior)

✅ Created fare groups based on quartiles

4. Categorical Variable Encoding
✅ Label Encoding: Applied to binary variable (Sex)

✅ One-Hot Encoding: Applied to nominal variables (Embarked, Title, Age_Group, Fare_Group)

5. Outlier Detection & Treatment
✅ Used IQR method for outlier detection

✅ Visualized outliers using boxplots

✅ Capped extreme fare values at 95th percentile

6. Feature Scaling
✅ Normalization: Min-Max scaling (0-1 range)

✅ Standardization: Z-score normalization (mean=0, std=1)

✅ Compared and visualized scaling effects

📊 Dataset Information
Original Dataset:

Rows: 891 passengers

Columns: 12 features

Target: Survived (0/1)

After Preprocessing:

Rows: 891 passengers (no data loss)

Columns: 30+ features (engineered features added)

Missing Values: 0 (all handled)

Scaled Features: Standardized numerical features

🔍 Key Preprocessing Steps
1. Missing Value Analysis
Column       Missing Count   Missing %
Cabin        687            77.1%
Age          177            19.9%
Embarked     2              0.2%
2. Feature Engineering Results
Titles Extracted: Mr, Mrs, Miss, Master, Rare (grouped)

Family Size Range: 1-11 members

Age Groups: 5 categories

Fare Groups: 4 quartile-based groups

3. Encoding Summary
Binary Encoding: Sex → Sex_Encoded

One-Hot Features: 20+ dummy variables created

Ordinal Preserved: Pclass maintained as-is

4. Outlier Treatment
Fare Outliers: 24 extreme values capped

Method: 95th percentile capping

Reasoning: Preserve data while reducing noise

📈 Key Insights Discovered
Survival Patterns:

Women had 74% survival rate vs 19% for men

First-class passengers: 63% survival rate

Children had higher survival rates

Data Quality Issues:

High cabin data missing (77%) - converted to binary feature

Age missing follows patterns by class and gender

Fare has extreme outliers requiring treatment

Feature Relationships:

Strong correlation between Pclass and Fare

Family size affects survival probability

Title extraction reveals social status information
